# AI-8queens-GeneticAlgorithm
The 8 Queens problem using genetic algorithm in python

NOTE: The number of queens (8 or 15) needs to be hardcoded under the section
#-------- MAIN -------#

How to run the code:

1) Open the code in a python editor
2) Under the comment #-------- MAIN -------#, you'll find the variables that govern the program run
3) To modify Mutation probability, change value of MutationPct to any value between (0.0 - 1.0)
4) To modify the population size, change value of PopulationSize
5) To modify the number of iterations for which a the code can run till it can give, change value of NumIterations
